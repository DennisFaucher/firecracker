Learning Firecracker "Serverless" MicroVMs

## Why?
I have been reading about simple, fast, programmatic virtual machines. First, I learned Ubuntu Multipass (full-fat, but quick to deplot VMs), and then moved on to Firecracker.

## Challenges
Many of the public firecracker tutorials failed for me at some point in the tutorial. I took the working portions of the first few tutorials I tried and combined them into a process that works for me

## Goals
- Running VM
- Ability to Login to the VM
- Ability for VM to access the Internet
